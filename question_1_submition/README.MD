how to execute:

	1. Open terminal 
	2. navigate to the directory where you saved the 'question_1_cla.py' via cd in terminal
	3. in terminal type :
	
		$ python question_1_cla.py complete/path/to/an/already/existing/directory/where/you/want/to/store/the/results/

			
	4. Example:
	
		$ python question_1_cla.py /home/user/Downloads/sem_6/CS_671_DL/Assignment_1/cla_test/
			




expected output:

	1.directories with name 'class_?' will be created in the directory that you provided	#where '?' will be an integer in range 1 to 96 (both included)
	2.each of these directories (class_?) will contain 1000 intra-class variant images (stating of line randomly generated) ,and a directory named 'frames' containing 10 image frames generated by 90 images picked randomly from the same class ;each frame have 9 images. These image-frames are used to generate the video named 'video_from_frames.avi'. 
	3.video named 'video_from_frames.avi' will be created in the directory that you provided .Duration of the video = 8_mins(480_secs) played at 2FPS (contains 960 frames).
	
	
	
	
Dependencies :

	1.opencv (cv2) specifically : VideoWriter, VideoWriter_fourcc : to create video from frames
	2.glob :to perform Unix style pathname pattern expansion
	3.os :to make directories
	4.random : to generate random integers and to pic unique random sample from range
	5.numpy : to compute tangents (for slope) and arrays from images
	6.scipy.misc
	7.PIL specifically : Image, ImageDraw: for image creation,opening and drawing
	8.sys : for command line arguments
	
tests:
	the mentioned ('question_1_cla.py') was tested on 64bit Linux machine (distro: BOSS) running :Python 3.7.1
